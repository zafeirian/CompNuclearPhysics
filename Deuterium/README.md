# Deuterium
As presented at "Massen's Notes on Quantum Mechanincs", a simple model for Deuterium's potential is the following:

Using this spherically symmetric potential well, we can study the s-bounded states (l=0) of Deuterium's atom. By solving Schrodinger's Equation on both A and B areas, we obtain the following wavefunction.
