# Deuterium
As presented at "Massen's Notes on Quantum Mechanincs", a simple model for Deuterium's potential is the following:

The aim of this project is to find the values of $V_0$ and $L^2$ of this well. This is a spherically symmetric potential well, so we study the s-bounded states (l=0) of Deuterium's atom. By solving Schrodinger's Equation on both A and B areas, we obtain the following wavefunction.
